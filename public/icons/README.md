# PWA Icons

Place your PWA icon files here:

- `icon-192.png` - 192x192 pixels
- `icon-512.png` - 512x512 pixels

You can generate these icons using:
- [PWA Asset Generator](https://github.com/onderceylan/pwa-asset-generator)
- [RealFaviconGenerator](https://realfavicongenerator.net/)
- Any image editor (export as PNG)

For now, the app will work without these icons, but they're required for full PWA functionality and app installation.
